# portfolio
This is the repo for my portfolio site, it uses React with a Node.js backend.

The idea being that I can update parts of the site being some main text content as well as add new projects for viewing withput having to constanly jump into the front end of my site.

This was a big learning curve for me, as my React experience grows and there wasn't anything overtly challenging with it I had never before used Node.js and wanted to get to grips with this language so I would one, gain backend experience and two, could make some more dynamic websites for personal projects.

I expect this project to expand over time as I revise parts of the UI or introduce Redux or Graph QL where possible.
